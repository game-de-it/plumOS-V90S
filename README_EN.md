## OS Hotkeys
| Button Combo | Action | 
|:-------------|--------:|
| SELECT+Vol+  | Increase screen brightness |
| SELECT+Vol-  | Decrease screen brightness |
| SELECT+R2    | Enable left analog stick emulation |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Pressing SELECT+R2 will make the D-pad emulate an analog stick, which may disable cursor movement, etc.  
> Pressing SELECT+R2 again will revert the D-pad to normal functionality, allowing cursor movement again.

## RetroArch Hotkeys
- RetroArch hotkey settings can be changed by editing the `Batocera.conf` file under the systemc directory.

| Button Combo | Action | 
|:-------------|--------:|
| SELECT+B     | Open RetroArch menu |
| SELECT+R     | Save state |
| SELECT+L     | Load state |
| SELECT+R2    | Fast forward |
| SELECT+L2    | Slow motion |
| SELECT+X     | Take a screenshot |
| SELECT+Y     | Show FPS |

> [!WARNING]
> SELECT+R2 (Fast Forward) conflicts with the analog stick emulation described earlier.  
> In most games that work with RetroArch, the left analog stick can substitute for the D-pad, so this usually wonâ€™t be an issue.  
> If you experience problems like being unable to move the cursor, press SELECT+R2 again to revert.

## About USB-DAC
- You can connect or disconnect the USB-DAC even during gameplay, but it is recommended to do so before starting a game.

## About USB Wi-Fi Dongles

- The TP-Link Archer T3U Nano/A Wi-Fi dongle has been confirmed to work.
    - It has high power consumption, so we recommend unplugging it when not in use.

That's all.
